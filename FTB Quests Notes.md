Spawn of vanilla mansion is not disabled? I had found vanilla and modded mansion really close to each other.
> The Pillager Castle isn't meant to replace the Woodland Mansion, they're both their own structures.

---
Repeatable quest mark is not consistent in description (look Tarou Quest and Farming Quest)
> The repeatable quests thing is a known issue, working on in dev.

---
Copycat+ is a god tier mod, framed blocks is counterpart, but cc+ is more consistent with modded textures and works perfectly with vanilla textures. These mods can be used alongside.

Quests with this problem: **Snail Mail, Camera (Miscellaneous); Neapolitan (Gathering); Chipped (Building)**; 

# Basics

## Beginning

## Equipment and Gear

## Miscellaneous 
(Miscellaneous Frame) "How did we get here?" quest: advancement is not possible at all, "Furious Cocktail" is possible (I checked it), you need all vanilla potions + Repellance, Vibing (Upgrade Aquatic), Resilience (Quark), Health Boost (Enviromental)

# Homesteading

## Farming & Gardening
Straw hat quest: sweaty and not sweety in subtitle, is it intended?
> Yes, the "sweaty" is intended, it's a meme haha

---
Rich soil quest: punctuation error !.

---
Farmer's Delight quest: mod's name is not in bold

---
Compact Your Crops quest: "Place 9 of each material in a Crafting Grid" Was it supposed to be "Place 9 of material (or crop)"?

## Culinary Arts
(The Spice of Life Frame) It is hillarious, that you need to kill a cow and make a Hamburger to unlock vegetable dishes quest, which says "Vegatarian? No worries, we got you covered!", so savage lol

---
(The Spice of Life Frame) Spice of Life (Essences) quest: image used is outdated https://discord.com/channels/@me/1271144831728488590/1281612619744280638

---
(Tea & Sundry Frame) Tea quests:
- no guide on obtaining different types of tea leaves (green, yellow, black): haunting with Create's Encased Fan is not only the way — you can wait for grown green tea bush to become yellow tea bush or black tea bush
- no info about Wild Tea Bushes (spawns in swamps, if it wasn't changed)
- tea bushes can't be grown on farmlands as they can't be planted there, they are grown on grass only (tea bushes could be planted on farmlands like 1 year ago but were dissapearing from existence that way)

---
(Nether's Delight Frame) Duplicate of Farming and Gardering Soul Compost quest

---
(Nether's Delight Frame) Propelplants quest: "They look similar to Bamboo" They look similar to Sugar Canes, and you don't need Shears to collect Propelpearls, you can simply right click the berries

---
(The Cooking Pot Frame) Skillet quest description is simply misleading? "The &bSkillet&r allows you to cook on the go! Simply &6stand near a heat source&r and &6add your ingredients&r!" 
- Skillet is a smoker alternative and it can hold up to 64 items
- You can't just stand near heat source with the Skillet, you need to place it with Shift+RMB. 
- Skillet can be enchanted with any sword enchantments. And fire aspect accelerates Skillet's cooking speed down to 6 seconds (smoker is 5s).

---
(Winery & Such Frame) No quest for wine collection and wine box storages :sadge:

---
(Winery & Such Frame) reward is wine bottle and not grape juice and second next quest requires wine bottle. Player can skip the quest (and it's description) because of that

## Fishing & Gathering

## Building & Decorating
(Decorating Frame) Handcrafted first quest: yeah, I always think of Sawmill when in fact I'm searching for Stonecutter. And there is no sawmill in the game, yeah

## Storage

# Magic and the Arcane

## Hexerei
Meet the Crow quest: image used in quest is outdated https://discord.com/channels/@me/1271144831728488590/1281605945734074554

## Ars Nouveau
Arcane Pedestal quest: Source Stone is referred as Arcane Stone. I'm not sure if this is an error.

## Create
Starbuncle wheel quest: with gold block, sb generates 384 su instead of 320

---
Creative Blaze Cake quest: 100 cakes for 1 infinite cake is too little. Creative Blaze Cake is not consumed on use even in survival mode and quest is repeatable. Maybe tune it a bit?

## Malum
No info about Weave and Weavers Workbench (customizing armor's look)

# Exploring

## Twilight Forest

## The End
Corrupted Eye: "Pillager Tower" so Pillager Outpost? It is, in fact, watchtower, but outpost is more correct, I think.

---
The Beginning of the End: "Space Whales" Maybe End Whales?

---
Advancement: "Ender Elites"? End Cities probably weren't built by endermen from the beginning, entrances in cities are *2 blocks high* and, probably, were built by humans. OR villagers and Illagers who were parts of single civilisation, who built strongholds, End Cities, ships with dragon heads attached to them and etc. But who got corrupted by the void in the end (no pun intended)   https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YkG386_-TBM/sddefault.jpg?v=61041390
Yes, that research was made for this quest only. Why?

## Wildlife
(Tameable Creatures Frame) Meet The Owl: "game meat"? Maybe vanilla meat?
> "Game meat" refers to wild meat like rabbit, as opposed to Steak or Pork Chops. I guess because hunting was considered a game?

## Globetrotting
(Structure Frame) Labyrinth of the Serpent: Saying "dangers and even final boss" is understatement. I prepared different description — "But &ddon't be in a hurry to go in there&r. There are many dangers lurking inside. And at the end, an incredibly strong and ferocious monster awaits to wipe the pesky intruders from the face of the earth." I think you can say he is incredibly strong as he slams as a truck (3 hearts of damage through IV Prot Netherite armor).

---
(Structure Frame) Castle: Castle is Aqua text, should be Red

---
(Waystones Frame) Waystone: Village is Pink text, should be Red

# Collecting

## Collections
Flower subtittles are not complete
